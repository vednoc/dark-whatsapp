> A customizable style for WhatsApp.


# About

A rewrite of my style to better suit recent WhatsApp updates. Because the style exceeded my expectations of how well it was received, I decided to put it into a separate repository after the rewrite with a goal to make it even better with the help from members of the community.


# Preview

_Do note the screenshot showcased is the version before rewrite. There are a few features missing, but they will make their return within the next few updates._

**NOTE:** _Stylish_ isn't supported ([install from here if you're still using *Stylish*](https://userstyles.org/styles/142096)); it's obsolete and you should replace it with Stylus.
