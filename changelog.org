** 3.7.2 [2023-03-31 Fri]
Yet another maintenance release to fix compact mode, rounded avatars, alerts,
big emoji size, and message tails features.  Starting from alerts and going
onwards, code is now much simpler and resistant to updates that only change
selectors, so it should last for a long time.

*** Fixed
- Updated selectors for rounded avatars (#196, #198)
- Updated selectors for compact mode (#200, #201)

** 3.7.1 [2023-01-15 Sun]
Another maintenance release that fixes a bunch of things in different areas. If
you find bugs, please report them to our issue tracker.

** 3.7.0 [2021-07-09 Fri]
This is a maintenance release to fix the latest update as well as simplify
styles for a number of features. The code should be more maintainable than
before, especially for Dark-WhatsApp's most unique feature: the compact mode.

Also, UserStyles.world has been rewritten a while ago. If you're experienced
with Go programming language (and/or HTML/CSS/TS/JS), [[https://github.com/userstyles-world/userstyles.world][check out the source code]].
Stylus =v1.5.18= (now in beta) allows you to browse as well as upload your styles
directly to USw with ease. We're looking for feedback to make that process, as
well as the website, even better. Check it out here:

🌟 https://userstyles.world 🌟

Notice: I didn't test /all/ the available features, but I can say with certainty
that Facebook-style message tails no longer work (since 3.6.x release) and RTL
fixes have been implemented by WA. If some other feature stopped working, open
an issue and I'll have a look at it. The support for the aforementioned
functionality has been dropped due to amount of code that is required for
maintenance, but it's not removed yet.

*** Added
- Changed the =@updateURL= fields of both userstyles to use UserStyle.world's API
  + This will allow me to have an insight in basic statistics in order to see to
    what extent DWA is being used and whether it should be maintained or not.
    GitHub's insights are pretty much useless, so this will help greatly.

*** Improvements
- Rewrote =compact mode= from the scratch. It's as simple as it gets
- Switched to other types of selectors other than hard-coded class selectors
  + I would like to do it for more elements, but unfortunately it is what it is.

*** Fixed
- Updated selectors for pretty much everything
- Updated rounded corners for avatars ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/189][#189]])
- Added proper text color to attach menu tooltips ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/188][#188]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/190][#190]])

** 3.6.1 [2021-03-03 Wed]
As mentioned in the announcement note in the previous release, I'm looking for
someone to help maintain this userstyle. This is one of the last, if not the
very last update that I'll be doing. I've been working on this userstyle since
2017 and it's time to pass the torch to someone else.

If you're interested, you can reach out to me on GitHub, on GitLab, via e-mail,
via Discord, or via Matrix.

Thank you for understanding.

** 3.0.0 [2020-09-03 Thu]
The =v3= release is here! It took around 3 months to get here, and a ton of work.

There are no deprecated features and there is a new one to adjust syntax color
tones. For full list, look for /added/ sections the previous releases.

Overall, I'm quite happy with how everything turned out — especially the
=whatsapp.sh= tool. Huge thanks to everyone who contributed, and to [[https://github.com/E-RELevant/][Erel]] for
helping out a ton behind the scenes.

Erel also made a [[https://github.com/E-RELevant/WhatsApp-Web-Skeleton][WA Skeleton]] theme that can be used as a "screenshot mode" of
sorts — which will hide all sensitive information — and you can use it to
showcase your DWA theme in [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/178][this issue]] to show everyone how you use it.

Finally, I wrote a blog post that highlights this update. You can [[https://vednoc.me/blog/next-gen-of-dark-whatsapp][read it here]].

*** Build
- Added brand new options to the [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/blob/master/whatsapp.sh][whatsapp.sh]] utility

*** Fixed
- Updated a few regressions introduced when refactoring syntax color variables
- Updated colors for prev/next item in media viewer

** 3.0.0-rc.7 [2020-08-27 Thu]
Not many changes in this release; just updating styles to WhatsApp `v2.2035.12`
update, and adding an announcement for my new project --- [[https://userstyles.world/][UserStyles.World]] ---
that I've launched a few days ago as an alternative to =userstyles.org=, which has
been quite unusable for many months now.

If you'd like to contribute to development of USW, do check out the GitHub
[[https://github.com/vednoc/userstyles.world][project repository]]. If you're a userstyle creator, there's a section on
[[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS-authors][OpenStyles/Stylus Wiki]] in regards to writing UserCSS userstyles that will allow
you to host them on GitHub/GitLab or elsewhere. The process is pretty easy and
well documented, but I'll be adding something simpler to USW at some point.

There is just a handful of userstyles added at the moment since I'm a one-man
team (at the time of writing), and other priorities on the list take a lot of my
time to research and implement. Here's a short [[https://github.com/vednoc/userstyles.world/issues/1][Roadmap]] to keep track of ideas.

** 2.9.0 [2020-06-05 Fri]
Rewriting everything so that we can utilize WhatsApp's native CSS variables. All
of this is thanks to the ~2.2023.2~ update that broke /a lot/ of things.

*** Added
We are releasing a preview of our procedural color generation for background,
foreground, and accent colors in this update. Two months ago, we published
initial work for it in [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/145][#145]]; today, we're releasing it to everyone.

This is something we've been working towards for quite a while now, making over
a dozen of different implementations to find the right one. Since there are 6
tones for all base colors, the interop with [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][Dark-Switcher]] is no longer possible
until this functionality is implemented there.

What you see is still early-days, since we have to polish color generator rules
and include edge-cases, as well as see how it does /in the wild/. If you run into
issues, or weird looking color generation, we would love to hear it! Don't
hesitate to open a new [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/new/choose][issue]] and tell us about it.

Quick preview of changing base background and accent colors:

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18245694/83881589-33ae5f80-a741-11ea-8db3-f5edb1b1597d.gif]]

*** Broken features
A lot of our previous work is now broken in the new update, and we'll have to
rewrite or fix majority of the features you can find on [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/wiki/Configuration][Configuration]] page on
our project wiki. Only the following features made it into ~v2.9.0~ release:

- Custom background/foreground/accent colors
- All app background image options
- Custom intro image
- Custom UI font

We will slowly but surely bring old features back in the upcoming updates as we
make our way towards ~v3~ of Dark-WhatsApp.

*** Fixed
- Issues where the new update was reported ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/158][#158]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/159][#159]])
- Unreadable 'update alert' text color ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/155][#155]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/157][#157]])

  - Here is [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/wiki/Configuration#message-tails][how to enable it]]! Quick preview:

    [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18245694/82741377-86efdd80-9d51-11ea-84d8-2ccb1315f346.gif]]
