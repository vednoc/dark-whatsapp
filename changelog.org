** 2.9.0 [2020-06-05 Fri]
Rewriting everything so that we can utilize WhatsApp's native CSS variables. All
of this is thanks to the ~2.2023.2~ update that broke /a lot/ of things.

*** Added
We are releasing a preview of our procedural color generation for background,
foreground, and accent colors in this update. Two months ago, we published
initial work for it in [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/145][#145]]; today, we're releasing it to everyone.

This is something we've been working towards for quite a while now, making over
a dozen of different implementations to find the right one. Since there are 6
tones for all base colors, the interop with [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][Dark-Switcher]] is no longer possible
until this functionality is implemented there.

What you see is still early-days, since we have to polish color generator rules
and include edge-cases, as well as see how it does /in the wild/. If you run into
issues, or weird looking color generation, we would love to hear it! Don't
hesitate to open a new [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/new/choose][issue]] and tell us about it.

Quick preview of changing base background and accent colors:

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18245694/83881589-33ae5f80-a741-11ea-8db3-f5edb1b1597d.gif]]

*** Broken features
A lot of our previous work is now broken in the new update, and we'll have to
rewrite or fix majority of the features you can find on [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/wiki/Configuration][Configuration]] page on
our project wiki. Only the following features made it into ~v2.9.0~ release:

- Custom background/foreground/accent colors
- All app background image options
- Custom intro image
- Custom UI font

We will slowly but surely bring old features back in the upcoming updates as we
make our way towards ~v3~ of Dark-WhatsApp.

*** Fixed
- Issues where the new update was reported ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/158][#158]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/159][#159]])
- Unreadable 'update alert' text color ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/155][#155]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/157][#157]])

*** About v1.x.x version
*TL;DR:* It is going away soon.

When the script is done, the version 2.x.x will be compiled to =wa.user.css= file.
USo userstyle will be updated shortly after with this version.
