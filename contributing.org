* Getting Involved
There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of
Dark-WhatsApp.

Even if you've never contributed to an Open Source project before, we're always
looking for help identifying missing styles or other issues.

* How to Report Style Issues
** I don't know CSS
If you don't know CSS very well and have found a missing style, please include
as much as possible of following information when opening an issue:

- Screenshot of the problem
- Include the element(s) in the console if at all possible
  - To select an element, target it with your mouse then right-click and choose
    "Inspect Element", otherwise press `Ctrl + Shift + C` and select it with
    your left mouse click
  - Copy the HTML if at all possible

** I know both CSS & GitHub
- *Recommended:* [[#duplicate-the-style][duplicate]] the style or [[#create-a-companion-style][create a "companion style"]]
- Follow the [[#style-guide][style guide]] below
- Make any needed changes, then send us a pull request
- Please include a URL to the page (if public)

*** Duplicate the style or create a "companion style"
When a userstyle is installed from a page, Stylus stores the url of that page
internally along with the CSS style.

If that userstyle is then modified or even renamed, it will still maintain the
original install location, but all automatic updates of the modified userstyle
will be blocked to preserve local changes. A manual update of that userstyle is
required to update, but be warned that an update *will overwrite* all changes,
i.e. *all modifications will be lost*!

To get around this, either duplicate it or create a "companion style".

**** Duplicate the style
The easiest way is to copy and paste the source code into a new, *local* style.

1. Copy the style
    - Open Dark-WhatsApp in the [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor][Stylus' Editor]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]]
    - Copy the code directly from the edit window.
    - If not all content is automatically selected in the popped up window, use Select All (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@A@@html:</kbd>@@), then Copy (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@C@@html:</kbd>@@) the style.
2. Paste into a new style
    - Click "Write new style" in the [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Manager][Stylus' Manager]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]]
    - Paste (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@V@@html:</kbd>@@) the style into the code block area.
    - Give the style a name, then save.

**** Create a "companion style"
Please refer to the [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Writing-styles#making-a-companion-style][Stylus' Writing Styles page]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]] for more details.

* Getting Started
** Style guide
- Limit to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_BSD_KNF][K&R (KNF variation style)]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]], and *TAB SPACE INDENTATION* (not more,
  and not less than 4 spaces).
  - Use [[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]] plugin for your editor if at all possible, and let it take
    care of indentation.

- K&R - KNF Variation Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  element[attr='value'] {
  ····property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- *Not* Allman
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  element[property='value']
  {
  ····property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- Strict space between the =selector= and the ={=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
    /* good */
    element[attr='value'] { }
    /* bad */
    element[attr='value']{ }
  #+END_SRC

- Don't go multi-line for simple one-liners
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  element { property: value }
  /* bad */
  element {
      property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- 4 [Tab] Space indentation
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  ····property: value;
  /* bad */
  ··property: value;
  --property: value;
  ·property: value;
  #+END_SRC

- Use the provided mixins and variables

  You can find more about them at the top of the =wa.user.styl= file. Also, use
  [[http://stylus-lang.com/][stylus-lang documentation]]
  [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]]
  to get familar with Stylus-lang syntax and features.

  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  element { c: #eee 0 #333 }
  /* best */
  element { c: fg1 0 bg1 }
  /* bad */
  element {
    color: #eee,
    background-color: #333;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- Try to wrap lines at around 80 characters.
- This style does not have a size limit, but:
  - If possible, reduce any added selectors. Remember that the style likely has
    an =!important= flag to override default styling, so a selector starting from
    the body isn't always necessary.
  - If your CSS definition already exists within the style, do not add it again!
    Add your selector to the existing definition.
- Insert any new CSS selectors in any available slot before the style
  definition, or on a new line as needed.
- If you want to add a new userstyle variable/feature, please open an issue and
  discuss it with us first.
- Don't include version bumps with your contribution, all releases are handled
  internally.
- If your pull request (PR) fixes an open issue or replaces another PR, include
  fixes/closes =#issue-number= in your commit message title. [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords][Read more on this]]

** Testing changes of a local userstyle
- Open the =wa.user.styl= file in your browser, and make sure to have "live
  preview" checked for testing
  - If you're using a Chromium-based browser, go to /extensions/, open /details/ for
    Stylus, and enable "Allow access to file URLs".
- Make some changes then save the file, and Stylus will do its magic
